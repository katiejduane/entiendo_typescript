Core Types:
- number (in JS/TS number types do not differentiate between integers or floats)
- string (text; single quotes, double quotes, or back ticks)
- boolean (true, false; just these two, no 'truthy' or 'falsy' types)


TypeScript types VS. JavaScript types:
- The main thing to remember is JS is dynamically typed; a variable can be a string
first, and later a number or boolean. With TS, you use static types, you must be clear 
and declare a type; it cannot change on a whim.

    * Core primitive types in TS are lowercase!!! (string, number, boolean; NOT String, etc)
